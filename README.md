This iOS architecture exhibits a solid foundation, employing MVVM for structure, Swift 5 for coding, Alamofire for networking, and Storyboards for UI design and navigation. Using segues for information transfer is reasonable, but consider refining data handling with patterns like dependency injection or delegates for enhanced flexibility. https://github.com/kudoleh/iOS-Clean-Architecture-MVVM
